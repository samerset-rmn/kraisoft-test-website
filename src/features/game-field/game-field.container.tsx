/**

 * NOTE Why did I shoose @dnd-kit library? I was making a decision with the following in mind:
 * 1. Game should support touch events (website has responsive design and should work on mobile devices)
 * 2. Game should support keyboard events (for accessibility)
 * 3. Library should be actively maintained, performant and should has a low bundle size
 *
 * At first I wanted to use native Drag and Drop browser API, but it has some limitations. For example:
 * doesn't support touch and keyboard events, doesn't support parent boundary restriction. Many features
 * can be done only with hacks. So I decided to use a library.
 *
 * [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable?tab=readme-ov-file) is a good library
 * that still actively maintained and has a low bundle size. But as far I can see it doesn't support keyboard events.
 *
 * [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) is made by Attlasian, but has a big bundle size.
 *
 * [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit) looks like a good choice. It has support for touch and keyboard events,
 * has a small bundle size (also modular and tree-shakeable), is well maintained, can potentially be framework agnostic,
 * finally it's flexible enough for custom logic. For now I'll stick with this library.
